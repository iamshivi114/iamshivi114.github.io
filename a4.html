      The picture above shows the schematic of the circuit with the Servo Motor and the circuit with the CapacitiveSensor. It also shows the reasoning for using the 1 megaohm resistor in the CapacitiveSensor.

    <h2>The Circuit</h2>

    <br>
    <p>
      The picture shows the circuit for the assignment.
      It has a power and a ground connection through the arduino.
      The circuit has a capacitive sensor that has a 1 megaohm resistor between pin 2 and pin 4. Pin 2 is the sensor.
      It also has a servo motor attached to pin 9 of the arduino.
      Finally, the circuit has a blue LED light connected with a 100 ohm resistor that indicates when a touch is made. The LED is connected to digital output pin 13.

    <h2>Circuit's Operation</h2>
    <br>
    <video class="resize-image" autoplay muted controls>
        <source src="a4operation.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">

    </video>
    <br>
    <p>
      The video shows the working of the circuit.
      The blue LED turns on when the CapacitiveSensor detects a touch. Along with that, the servo turns to an angle of 90 degrees.
      When there is no touch, the LED turns off, and the Servo returns to its original position.
      The change in the Serial Monitor is also shown. Serial Monitor depicts whether there's a touch,
      and what the capacitive sensor detected value is.

    <h2>Questions</h2>
    <br>
    <p><strong>
        Say you are using a servo motor you attach to pin 9. <br>
        In your loop() you have the following code: <br>
        for (int i=0, i<180, i++)
        {servo.write(i); delay(100);}
        Draw a graph with the X axis in seconds, for two seconds, and the y-axis the voltage at pin 9 with respect to ground.

    <p>
      The picture above shows the solution graph to the first question.

    <br>
    <p><strong>Your input device is slightly broken, leading it to give us an erroneous reading 1% of the time. How can we address this? Answer in (pseudo)code.</strong></p>
    <br>
        <pre><code>
            // use an array to store a 100 readings
            for (int i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++) {
            //value = sensor.read();
            // array.append(value);
            }
            // array.sort()
            // median = (array[49] + array[50]) / 2;
            // firstDiff = array[0] - median;
            // lastDiff = array[99] - median;
            // Whichever has more modulus difference, gets eliminated
            // This continues for every 100 readings
        </code></pre>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Your input device is slightly noisy, leading the measurement to randomly deviate from the true measurement up or down by 10%. How can we address this? Answer in (pseudo)code.</strong></p>
    <br>
    <pre><code>
        // for every input value,
        // value = sensor.read()
        // average_value = ((value * 0.9) + (value * 1.1)) / 2;
        // We take average of a 10% upper and lower value to mitigate the problem of input device measuring the values 10% up or down.
