      The picture above shows the schematic of the circuit with the photoresistor and the 10k resistor.
      It also shows the calculation of the voltage range detected at the A0 pin, and the resistance range through the photoresistor.
      It also states the reason for using a 10k resistor in the circuit.

    <h2>The Circuit</h2>
    <br>

    <br>
    <p>
      The picture shows the circuit for the assignment.
      It has voltage outputs in the 3, 5, 9 slots (green - 9, red - 5 (high-light), 3 (low-light)). Voltage input is through pin A0. This input detects the input between the photoresistor and the 10k resistor.
      220 ohm resistors are connected with the green and the red LEDs.
      The circuit has a power source of 5V connected to one arm of the photoresistor.
      The other arm is connected with input pin A0 and and a 10k ohm resistor.
      The circuit is powered by the Arduino.

    <br>
    <p>
      The video shows the working of the circuit. The green light starts blinking when the output from the analog pin is less than 30. The output is determined by the input from the A0 pin. When the photoresistor gets more light, the input voltage is higher (the first red light is brighter). Otherwise, when it gets less, the input voltage is lower (the second red light is brighter).

    <h2>Questions</h2>
    <br>
    <p><strong>1: In your voltage divider, can the variable resistor be either R1 or R2 or does it need to be one or the other? Justify your answer with example calculations.</strong></p>
    <br>
    <img src="a3q1.JPG" alt="Solution to question one" class="resize-image">
    <br>
    <p>
      The picture above shows the solution to the first question.
      The variable resistor can only be R1 for the purpose of our circuit.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Draw a graph where the x-axis is time and the y-axis is voltage. Plot the voltage at V-measure of your voltage divider of your shared gif.</strong></p>

      The image above shows the graph voltage time graph for the circuit represented in the video.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>AnalogWrite and analogRead are respectively 8-bit and 10-bit values. Imagine you had 10-bit PWM and a 16-bit analog-to-digital converter instead. How would this change your map() code? Explain your answer.</strong></p>
    <br>
    <p>
        In case, the analogRead returns a number that is 16-bit, the values can be between 0 and 65,535 (2^16 - 1). Consequently an analogWrite function that is 10 bit has a range of 0 to 1023. Therefore, the 16-bit value would need to be mapped to a 10-bit value by the map function.
        The changed map function is as follows:
        map(inputVal, 0, 65535, 0, 1023);
