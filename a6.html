    <h2>The Circuit</h2>

    <br>
    <p>
      The picture shows the circuit for the assignment. The joystick is connected to A5 and A2 pins for x and y inputs respectively. Since the input from the joystick is analog, we need to use those pins because they can detect analog input. Pin 2, 8, 13 are able to write digital inputs to the circuit.
      Everything has been grounded, and the joystick was connected to the 5V source.

      The video shows the working of the circuit.
      First, the joystick takes the input from the user, and changes the background of the webpage accordingly to red, yellow, green, or black.
      Second, the website takes input from the user in form of arrow keys, and lights up the LEDs in the circuit accordingly.
