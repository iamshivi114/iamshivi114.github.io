    <br>
    <p>
      The picture shows the circuit for the assignment.
      It has voltage outputs in the 9, 10, 11 slots (red - 9, yellow - 10, blue - 11). Voltage input is through pin 2.
      220 ohm resistors are connected with the red and the yellow LEDs.
      A 100 ohm resistor is connected to the blue LED.
      The circuit has a power source of 5V connected to one arm of the button.
      The other arm is connected with input pin 2 and and a 10k ohm resistor.
      The circuit is powered by the Arduino.

    <h2>Circuit's Operation</h2>
    <br>
    <img src="press.GIF" alt="GIF representing the circuit's operation when the button is pressed" />
    <br>
    <p>
      Initially, the blue light is blinking and the red one is fading in and out in a cycle.
      As soon as the button is pressed, the red light stops and the yellow light starts fading in and out in a cycle.
      The blue light still keeps blinking. The lights fade and blink in the intervals of 20ms.
    </p>
    <br>
    <img src="release.GIF" alt="GIF representing the circuit's operation when the button is released" />
    <br>
    <p>
      When the button is pressed, the yellow light fades in and out and the blue light keeps blinking.
      When it is released, the yellow light stops and the red light starts fading in and out.
      The blue light still keeps blinking. The lights fade and blink in the intervals of 20ms.

      The graph above represents the voltage across an LED (blue LED in this case) over time when different analog values are put through them. The pink represents analogWrite(led, 255), purple represents analogWrite(led, 128), and red represents analogWrite(led, 64).
