    <h2>Circuit's Operation</h2>

    </video>
    <br>
    <p>
      The video shows the working of the circuit.
      The value detected from the capacitive sensor determines the voltage through the gate pin of the transistor. This determines how much current would flow through the circuit.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Questions</h2>
    <br>
    <p><strong>
        What is the absolute maximum amount of current between pins 2 and 3?
    </strong></p>
    <br>
    <p>
      According to the documentation, the absolute maximum current between pins 2 and pins 3 is <em>80A</em>.
